Explain this code


This is a PHP script that generates an HTML page for an online store. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Initialization

The script starts by initializing a PHP session using ob_start() and requiring a configuration file sheep_core/config.php. It then creates a MySQLi connection to a database named "loja" on localhost.

HTML Structure

The script then outputs an HTML structure, including:

A <head> section with metadata, CSS links, and a title
A <body> section with several div containers:
.header: a top navigation bar with a logo and a shopping cart icon
.container: the main content area
.linha-produtos: a product listing area
.listaPedidos: a cart summary area
Product Listing

The script uses a PHP class Ler to read data from the database. It retrieves a list of products from the produtos table, ordered by date in descending order. For each product, it generates an HTML form with:

A product image
A product title and price
A hidden input field for the product ID and price
A "Add to Cart" button
Cart Summary

The script uses the same Ler class to read data from the carrinho table, which appears to store cart items. It retrieves a list of cart items and displays them in a summary area. For each item, it shows:

A product image
A product title and price
A "Remove from Cart" button
Cart Total

The script calculates the total cost of the items in the cart using a SQL query that sums up the prices of all items in the carrinho table. It displays the total cost in a footer area.

Other

The script uses several PHP variables and constants, such as HOME, which is not defined in this code snippet. It also uses a font awesome icon for the shopping cart and trash can icons.

Overall, this script appears to be a basic e-commerce page that displays a list of products, allows users to add them to a cart, and displays a summary of the cart contents with a total cost.
